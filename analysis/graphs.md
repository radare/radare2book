## Graph commands

Radare2 supports various types of graph available through commands starting with `ag`:
```
[0x00005000]> ag?
|Usage: ag<graphtype><format> [addr]
| Graph commands:
| agc[format] [fcn addr]  Function callgraph
| agf[format] [fcn addr]  Basic blocks function graph
| agx[format] [addr]      Cross references graph
| agr[format] [fcn addr]  References graph
| aga[format] [fcn addr]  Data references graph
| agd[format] [fcn addr]  Diff graph
| agi[format]             Imports graph
| agC[format]             Global callgraph
| agR[format]             Global references graph
| agA[format]             Global data references graph
| agg[format]             Custom graph
| ag-                     Clear the custom graph
| agn[?] title body       Add a node to the custom graph
| age[?] title1 title2    Add an edge to the custom graph
|
| Output formats:
| <blank>                 Ascii art
| v                       Interactive ASCII art
| t                       Tiny ASCII art
| d                       Graphviz dot
| j                       JSON ('J' for formatted disassembly)
| g                       Graph Modelling Language (GML)
| k                       SDB key-value
| *                       r2 commands
| w                       Web/image (see graph.extension and graph.web)
```

The structure of the commands is as follows: `ag <graph type> <output format>`.

For example, `agid` displays the imports graph in dot format, while `aggj`
outputs the custom graph in JSON format.

Here's a short description for every output format available:

- ** Ascii Art ** (e.g. `agf`)

	Displays the graph directly to stdout using ASCII art to represent
	blocks and edges.

	_Warning: displaying large graphs directly to stdout
	might prove to be computationally expensive and will make r2 not
	responsive for some time. In case of a doubt, prefer using the interactive
	view (explained below)._

- ** Interactive Ascii Art ** (e.g. `agfv`)

	Displays the ASCII graph in an interactive view similar to `VV` which
	allows to move the screen, zoom in / zoom out, ...

- ** Tiny Ascii Art ** (e.g. `agft`)

	Displays the ASCII graph directly to stdout in tiny mode (which is the
	same as reaching the maximum zoom out level in the interactive view).

- ** Graphviz dot ** (e.g. `agfd`)

	Prints the dot source code representing the graph, which can be
	interpreted by programs such as
	[graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) or online viewers like
	[this](http://www.webgraphviz.com/)

- ** JSON ** (e.g. `agfj`)

	Prints a JSON string representing the graph.
	- In case of the `f` format (basic blocks of function), it will have
	detailed information about the function and will also contain the
	disassembly of the function (use `J` format for the formatted
	  disassembly.
	- In all other cases, it will only have basic information about the
	nodes of the graph (id, title, body, and edges).


- ** Graph Modelling Language ** (e.g. `agfg`)

	Prints the GML source code representing the graph, which can be interpreted by programs such as
	[yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed/download)

- ** SDB key-value ** (e.g. `agfk`)

	Prints key-value strings representing the graph that was stored by sdb
	(radare2's string database).

- ** R2 custom graph commands ** (e.g. `agf*`)

	Prints r2 commands that would recreate the desired graph. The commands
	to construct the graph are `agn [title] [body]` to add a node and `age
	[title1] [title2]` to add an edge.  The `[body]` field can be expressed
	in base64 to include special formatting (such as newlines).

	To easily execute the printed commands, it is possible to prepend a dot
	to the command (`.agf*`).

- ** Web / image ** (e.g. `agfw`)

	Radare2 will convert the graph to dot format, use the `dot` program to
	convert it to a `.gif` image and then try to find an already installed
	viewer on your system (`xdg-open`, `open`, ...) and display the graph there.
	The extension of the output image can be set with the `graph.extension` config
	variable. Available extensions are `png, jpg, gif, pdf, ps`.

	_Note: for particularly large graphs, the most recommended extension is
	`svg` as it will produce images of much smaller size_

	If `graph.web` config variable is enabled, radare2 will try to display
	the graph using the browser (_this feature is experimental and unfinished, and
	disabled by default._)
