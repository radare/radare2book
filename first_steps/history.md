## History

The radare project began in February of 2006 to provide a free and simple command-line hexadecimal editor with support for 64-bit offsets. The intention was to use the tool to perform searches and help recover data from hard-disks.

Since then, the project has evolved to provide a complete framework for analyzing binaries while making use of basic *NIX concepts. Those concepts include the famous "everything is a file", "small programs that interact using stdin/stdout", and "keep it simple" paradigms.

It was initially mostly a single-person project, these days gathered huge community and substantial amount of contributors.
Moreover, if you have some ideas or source code contributions, be sure to open an issue in [radare2 GitHub](https://github.com/radare/radare2) or send a pull request.

The central focus of this project is advanced hexadecimal editor. Additionally, the project has an assembler/disassembler, code/data analysis and graphing tools, scripting features, easy Unix integration, and more.
