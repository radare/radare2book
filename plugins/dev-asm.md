## Static plugins in core

Pushing a new architecture into the main branch of r2 requires to modify several files in order to make it fit into the way the rest of plugins are built.

List of affected files:

* `plugins.def.cfg` : add the asm.mycpu plugin name string in there
* `libr/asm/p/mycpu.mk` : build instructions
* `libr/asm/p/asm_mycpu.c` : implementation
* `libr/include/r_asm.h` : add the struct definition in there

Check out how the NIOS II cpu was implemented by reading those commits:
