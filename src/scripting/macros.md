# Macros

Apart from simple sequencing and looping, radare2 allows to write
simple macros, using this construction:
```
[0x00404800]> (qwe; pd 4; ao)
```

This will define a macro called 'qwe' which runs sequentially first 'pd 4' then 'ao'.
Calling the macro using syntax `.(macro)` is simple:

```
[0x00404800]> (qwe; pd 4; ao)
[0x00404800]> .(qwe)
0x00404800  mov eax, 0x61e627      ; "tab"
0x00404805  push rbp
0x00404806  sub rax, section_end.LOAD1
0x0040480c  mov rbp, rsp

address: 0x404800
opcode: mov eax, 0x61e627
prefix: 0
bytes: b827e66100
ptr: 0x0061e627
refptr: 0
size: 5
type: mov
esil: 6415911,rax,=
stack: null
family: cpu
[0x00404800]>
```

To list available macroses simply call `(*`:
```
[0x00404800]> (*
(qwe ; pd 4; ao)
```

And if want to remove some macro, just add '-' before the name:
```
[0x00404800]> (-qwe)
Macro 'qwe' removed.
[0x00404800]>
```

Moreover, it's possible to create a macro that takes arguments, which comes in handy in some
simple scripting situations. To create a macro that takes arguments you simply add them to macro definition.

```
[0x00404800]
[0x004047d0]> (foo x y; pd $0; s +$1)
[0x004047d0]> .(foo 5 6)
;-- entry0:
0x004047d0      xor ebp, ebp
0x004047d2      mov r9, rdx
0x004047d5      pop rsi
0x004047d6	mov rdx, rsp
0x004047d9	and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0
[0x004047d6]>
```
As you can see, the arguments are named by index, starting from 0: $0, $1, ...

# Aliases

radare2 also offerrs aliases which might help you save time by quickly executing your most used commands. They are under `$?`

The general usage of the feature is: `$alias=cmd`

```
[0x00404800]> $disas=pdf
```

The above command will create an alias for `pdf`, which is `$disas`. And the running the command given below would print the disassembly of the main function.

```
[0x00404800]> $disas @ main
```

Apart from commands, you can also alias a text to be printed, when called.

```
[0x00404800]> $my_alias = $test input
[0x00404800]> $my_alias
test input
```
