# Visual Mode

The visual mode is a more user-friendly interface alternative to radare2's command-line prompt.  It uses HJKL or arrow keys to move around data and code, has a cursor mode for selecting bytes, and offers numerous key bindings to simplify debugger use.
To enter visual mode, use `V` command. To exit from it back to command line, press `q`.

## print modes aka Panels

The Visual mode uses "print modes" which are basically different panel that you can rotate. By default those are:

↻ **Hexdump panel** -> **Disassembly panel** → **Debugger panel** → **Hexadecimal words dump panel** → **Output C format panel** → **Op analysis color map panel** → **Annotated hexdump panel** ↺.

Notice that the top of the panel contains the command which is used, for example for the disassembly panel:

```
[0x00404890 16% 120 /bin/ls]> pd $r @ entry0
```
